# A new website with less animations and better image banners

This is a continuation on my celebrant website. There are fewer animations and transitions than previous designs. The main tools for this are HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
I  have constructed an entirely new backend to deal with any email enquiries the user may have.
I am using Hostinger to deploy this and other websites i have constructed.
