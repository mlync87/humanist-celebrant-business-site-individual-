# A new website with less animations and better image banners

This is a continuation on my celebrant website. There are fewer animations and transitions than previous designs. The main tools for this are HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
I have decided to remove previously constructed backend. Instead I've used emailJS to handle email enquiries from users. (query security settings)
I am using Hostinger to deploy this and other websites i have constructed. 
**REMINDER==Free trial for this ends soon.**
