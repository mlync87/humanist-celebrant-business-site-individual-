# A new website with less animations and better image banners.

This is a continuation on my humanist celebrant website. There are less animations and transitions than previous designs. The main tools for this are HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
I've decided to remove previously constructed backend. Instead I've used emailJS to handle email enquiries from users. (query security settings)
Using email.js does not have the depth of security I wish to have, as i am merely using this for a demo model for the client.
I will be using Hostinger to deploy this and other websites i have constructed. 
**REMINDER= =Free trial for this ends soon.**
I have attached a page containing some of the tiles the user will use to select services. I will be updating these as more services are offered over time.
